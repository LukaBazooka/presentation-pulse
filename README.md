Presentation aid that aims to provide feedback to speakers after their presentation. This is done by using Groq for a multimodal analysis of presentation delivery and audience response.

## Help to improve your presentations!
We record live presentations via the camera and microphone from the speaker's device. The results of this analysis are displayed on a web app where the speaker can see how long they took, a calculated audience engagement score, and a graph which shows audience engagement over time. They also get feedback points about things they can improve on. All metrics are provided in a clean, minimalist UI for easy analysis.
